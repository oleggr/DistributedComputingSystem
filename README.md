### What's inside

It's simple simulator of distributed multithreading computing system.
Main ability of the system is running different custom tasks.

With developing progress system will get ability to spread tasks computing in smart way.
System will evaluate task computational complexity and assign it to a suitable computational resource. 


### Quickstart

For now you can simply run the main file:
```
>> python3 main.py
```


### Run tests

Run below command:
```
>> pytest

Notice: not all test cases supported currently
```
